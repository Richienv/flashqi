Below, I’ve reframed the features into concise, actionable items suitable for a sprint backlog in an Agile development process. These are written as user stories with high-level descriptions, avoiding specific code details while providing enough clarity for a software engineer to implement. Each feature aligns with your requested adjustments for reading, speaking, and listening in your Mandarin learning web app. I’ll assume a two-week sprint, but you can adjust the scope based on your team’s capacity.

### Sprint Backlog: Mandarin Learning Web App Features

#### Feature 1: Reading - Paragraph Generation with Highlight Toggle
- **User Story**: As a Mandarin learner, I want to read a paragraph made from lesson words with a toggle to highlight grammar parts, so I can understand sentence structure better.
- **Description**: 
  - Generate a short paragraph (3–5 sentences) using words from a specific lesson.
  - Include a toggle button in the UI to enable/disable highlighting.
  - When highlighting is on, color-code parts of speech: subject (e.g., red), object (green), verb (blue), noun (yellow).
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Paragraph uses at least 5 lesson words and is grammatically correct.
  - Toggle button switches highlighting on/off instantly.
  - Colors are distinct and visible, with a legend explaining them.
- **Effort Estimate**: 3 story points (medium complexity: text generation + UI toggle).

#### Feature 2: Speaking - Practice Sentence List
- **User Story**: As a Mandarin learner, I want a list of sentences using lesson words to practice speaking, so I can improve my fluency with relevant vocabulary.
- **Description**: 
  - Create a list of 5–10 unique sentences incorporating lesson words.
  - Display each sentence with Mandarin text, pinyin, and English translation.
  - Present the list in a scrollable, user-friendly format.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Sentences are varied (e.g., statements, questions) and use at least 3 lesson words each.
  - Pinyin and translations are accurate and aligned with the Mandarin text.
  - List is easy to read on both desktop and mobile.
- **Effort Estimate**: 2 story points (low complexity: basic generation + display).

#### Feature 3: Listening - Song Recommendations with Toned Lyrics
- **User Story**: As a Mandarin learner, I want song recommendations with lyrics showing tones, so I can practice listening and pronunciation enjoyably.
- **Description**: 
  - Recommend 2–3 Chinese songs (pre-selected or matched to lesson words).
  - Display song titles, artists, and lyrics line-by-line with pinyin including tone marks.
  - Present in an expandable format (e.g., click song to see lyrics).
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Songs are beginner-friendly (e.g., “月亮代表我的心”) or use lesson words.
  - Lyrics show correct pinyin with tone marks (e.g., “nǐ” for tone 3).
  - UI allows easy navigation between songs and lyrics.
- **Effort Estimate**: 3 story points (medium complexity: content sourcing + tone formatting).

### Sprint Goal
**Goal**: Deliver an initial set of interactive learning tools (reading, speaking, listening) to enhance Mandarin vocabulary practice for users.

### Notes for the Team
- **Dependencies**: Requires a database of lesson words (Mandarin, pinyin, meaning, part of speech) and a small song library with lyrics.
- **Tech Stack**: Use existing frontend (e.g., React) and backend (e.g., Node.js) frameworks; leverage a pinyin library for tone marks.
- **Prioritization**: Start with Speaking (simplest), then Reading, then Listening.
- **Stretch Goal**: Add audio playback for sentences/songs if time allows.

### Total Effort
- **8 story points**: Fits a small team (2–3 developers) for a two-week sprint, assuming other tasks (bug fixes, testing) are included.
